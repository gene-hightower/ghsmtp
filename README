Gene Hightower's SMTP server.

A program to receive Internet (RFC 5321) mail.  This is a “personal
domain” type program that delivers mail for all addresses to a single
user's ~/Maildir.

Free software — AGPLv3 with OpenSSL exception.

Written using Standard C++ — plus PEGTL, (at one time Ragel, before
that Bison), OpenSSL, boost-iostreams, ldns, spf2, regdom, TinyCDB,
glog etc.  Compiles with recent GCC and Clang.

  libboost-all-dev   \
  libcdb-dev         \
  libfmt-dev         \

  libspf2-dev        \
  libunistring-dev   \
  pkg-config

Run it from (x)inetd or daemontools as a non-root user.  It will
accept mail and store it in that user's ~/Maildir.

I run it on the Fedora distribution of GNU/Linux/systemd — might also
work on other platforms.

Support for some useful SMTP extensions:

RFC 1870: Message Size Declaration
RFC 2920: Command Pipelining
RFC 3030: Transmission of Large and Binary MIME Messages
RFC 3207: Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security
RFC 3463: Enhanced Mail System Status Codes
RFC 6152: 8-bit MIME Transport
RFC 6531: Internationalized Email

The software works with IPv4 and IPv6, mostly.

I wrote this to experiment with and learn about Internet mail.  I do
use it as my every day SMTP server for a number of domains.
